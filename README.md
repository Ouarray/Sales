# Sales: 
I have worked with 2 libraries Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze and manipulate data 
First step : Drop NanN values
             Change the type of column
Second Step : Data exploration we answer some important question related to buisness 
             for ex : What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
                       What city sold the most product?
                       .......
             To answer these questions we use pandas and matplotlib methods
